- 192 images × 10 = 1920 samples
- But they are still the same 192 images
- The model sees no new information


1. Low‑frequency images have very weak visual features
At 1–256 Hz, the fiber barely moves.
The images look:
- almost static
- low contrast
- low texture
- very similar to each other
To a CNN, these images are hard to distinguish.
Meanwhile, high frequencies (4k, 8k, 16k, 22k) have:
- strong oscillations
- sharp patterns
- clear texture differences
So the model naturally learns high frequencies better.
